Notes
================================================

Internal signal flow (wiring inside the devices)
External signal flow (wiring outside the devices)

Most common line flow
--------------------------------------------
Mic -> preamp -> eq, comp, etc. -> A/D converter -> DAW rec. -> DAW playback -> D/A converter -> monitor control -> amp -> speaker

Why EQ, compression before DAW?
-------------------------------------------------
- stuff you’d have to do manually anyways in digital. Save yourself time by doing it before it goes into the DAW.
- it’s what the artist is hearing in the monitor, so you will probably get a better performance if it sounds good to them while recording.



what is the channel path and what is the monitor path?
--------------------------------------------------------
channel path: mic to the DAW (pre recorder)
monitor path: DAW to the monitors (post recorder)

Audio signal levels
----------------------
_dBu is a voltage measurement, but in decibels_

- mic lvl
- instrument lvl (HiZ)
- consumer line lvl (-10 dBu)
- professional line lvl (+4 dBu)
- Speaker lvl

Gain Stage
---------------------
- any point in which the level of the audio signal is adjusted
- mic
- preamp
- aux/direct/multibus
- line in level
- effects units
- mixbus

analog audio signal types
------------------------------
- unbalanced (signal & ground)
- balanced (signal +, signal - & ground)
- instrument (HiZ) (signal & ground)

balanced cable (XLR mic cable)
------------------------------
- first phase -> balance ->
- has a third connector that reverses the phase, then reverses it back at the end to cancel out any external noise that happened.
