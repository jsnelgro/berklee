- pretty much everything?
I'm thinking of things in terms of synchronous and async linear models. A recording of a song is sync because it has a clock that is always running and at point X, it will always be the same sound being produced. Async is something like a book, where the linear consuming of the media is necessary, but you move through that structure at your own pace.
