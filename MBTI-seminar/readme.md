- dimostrazione (a commitment to test knowledge through experience. Willing to fail and learn from mistakes)
- sensazione (the continual refinement of the senses to enliven experience)
- sfumato (literally "going up in smoke", a willingness to embrace ambiguity, paradox, and uncertainty)
- arte/scienza (the development of the balance between science, art, logic, and imagination. Whole-brain thinking)
- corporalitá (the cultivation of grace, ambidexterity, fitness, and poise. Mind/body connection?)
- connessione (always looking for the connections between things that aren't immediately apparent as being connected. The interconnectedness of all things and phenomena. "Systems Thinking")
