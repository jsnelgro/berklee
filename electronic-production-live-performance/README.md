notes
==================================
- ableton time, e.g. 16. 3. 2. corresponds to bar. beat. 16th.
- going to learn how to organize "places", adding folders to save favorites and such
- will be making our own drum kit
- drums -> Drum Rack ... to create a new empty drum rack
- check out Drums -> Drum Hits ... tons of awesome samples!
- DUB is Jamacian slang for "double" because it was a copy of the original with live effects being played on the board

DUB Production technique
-------------------------
- cuts: momentary volume up or down
- throws: momentary send up or down (to delay or reverb, etc)

tail: how long the throw takes to fade. Reverb tail is measured in milliseconds, delay is measured in "feeback", which is how much the volume changes when it comes back into the device. E.g. 90% feedback will set the volume to 90% of the previous delay tap's volume (the number sin the delay plugin of ableton represent how many 16th notes are in the delay. ? or something. 16 is one bar)

- track and remote are for midi mapping. Don't need to turn sync on. It's for being able to set the tempo.
